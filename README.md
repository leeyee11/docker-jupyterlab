    -p 8888:8888 = jupyterlab runs on port 8888 inside the container, we exposed this externally on port 8888.
    -e JUPYTER_LAB_ENABLE=yes = setting environment variable
    -v "$PWD":/home/jovyan/work = On container removal copy everything created/stored on jupyterlab (which exists on /home/jovyan/work inside the container) to the present_working_directory (directory from where you ran - docker run) of your local system.
